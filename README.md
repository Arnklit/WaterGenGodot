# WaterGenGodot
A tool for generating rivers in Godot

Very early tool, not ready for much use yet

Tool can currently create a mesh along a Path node and you can control the subdivisions and it has a pretty simple water shader.

Tool can now create distance maps to use for flow and foam maps. Currently I still need to do some manual adjustment for that, but it should all be automated soon.

* Note the repository has a copy of Zylann's terrain included at the moment as I'm using that for test scenes. https://github.com/Zylann/godot_heightmap_plugin
